OVERVIEW:
        https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html
        Following of LLVM documentation for a simple toy language implemented in C++.

OBJECTIVES:
        Learning of compiler techniques and LLVM backend built tools to generate code.
        This includes lexers, parsers, abstract syntax trees, LLVM environment and optimisations.
        Additionally, established and modern C++ features and practises.

TODO:
        Project on hold until I understand modern C++ conventions to a satisfactory degree.

        Add conditional operations, this isn't turing complete
        Refactor for more sensible programming practises i.e. remove global variables and
        organise more appropriate files. Extend language. Refactor to not use yucky virtual methods
        for inheritance (perhaps attempt to imitate inheritance without language tools?)
